# Buff-coding-challenge
Creating a simple page using html and css as per figma design given by a client.

1. Created a navbar which consists of logo(from svg file), a button for "book now", a button for "gift card" and a menu icon(from svg file).

2. A section which has a h2 tag for a heading "our mission" and has a paragraph.

3. Next is an article which has an empty card with a background colour, h2 tag and paragraph.

4. Footer is devided into 2 sections for the elements to display on the left and the elements to display on the right. I have used css grid for the right part.

Scope for improvement:
Can be made responsive design.
