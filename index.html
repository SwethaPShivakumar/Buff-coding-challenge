          In 2019, Emma took a plunge to create something unique, leaving behind
          a successful career in the retail and beauty industry and taking with
          her 15 years of insight into what makes an exceptional customer
          experience she plunged into the wild west of what is the world of nail
          salons in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appalled by the fact the industry is largely unregulated and by how
          low-grade high street salons had driven prices down in turn breeding a
          nasty underbelly of underpaid, overworked and (largely) unqualified
          nail technicians servicing the women of Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many other beauty experiences have been transformed over the years,
          nails had been left out in the cold. She believed that everyone
          deserves to enjoy expert nail care service in a clean, modern,
          luxurious space. Somewhere that specialised in their craft and sat
          between a high end beauty salon and the cheap and cheerful nail salons
          where prices are ridiculously cheap, hygiene is minimal and customer
          service seems to not be a consideration.
